# DSPack-continued

DSPack-continued is a set of components and classes to write multimedia
applications using Microsoft DirectShow.

The (original and discontinued DSPack by Henry Gourvest)[https://code.google.com/archive/p/dspack/source/default/commits]
was designed to work with DirectX 9 on Win9X, ME, 2000, and Windows XP
operating systems. DSPack-continued does not claim support for these old
windows versions anymore. It may work or not. It is currently used
successfully in Windows 7.

The main packages, but not all of the examples, compile with Delphi starting from version 2010.

This version supports Win64, which the original DSPack and the many other imports/forks from Google code likely don't.
